# NecoMind
Lightweight version of the well known 'neofetch' starring neco-arc, written in Rust!

## Running the program(Windows)
-Install Rust  
-Either manually install dependencies, use rust-analyzer in VSCode, or any IDE really  
-Run with 'cargo run'  
-You can also use 'cargo build --release' and run it as an exe using .\neco_mind\target\release\neco_mind.exe   
-Press 'q' to exit the program at any time  

## Todo List
-Add Linux/MacOS support(mainly for GPU detection)  
-Add customizability  
-Add update UI  
-Change resolution to computer resolution rather than the terminal's resolution
